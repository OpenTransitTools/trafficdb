TOMTOM Traffic
===============

Don't know much about their data (Dec 2020), but...


##TRAFFIC DENSITY

##### DESCRIPTION:

One dataset that TOMTOM offers (i.e., saw this on the CARTO site) is historic traffic volume (e.g., number of
vehicles on a road segment), broken out by the day/hour, as well as a daily average.

##### FORMAT:

The data has columns for sun, mon, tue..., which represent the average number of vehicles per hour for the given day.
Additionally, there's a sun_1, sun_2 ... sun_23, mon_1 ... mon_23, tue_1 ... etc... that shows the number of
vehicles on that road segment during that hour of that given day.
